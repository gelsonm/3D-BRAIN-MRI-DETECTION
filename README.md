# Introduction
A brain tumor is a growth of cells in the brain that multiplies in an uncontrolled, abnormal way. Some brain tumors are noncancerous (benign), and some are cancerous (malignant).

## Glioma 
* A glioma is a tumor that forms in the brain or spinal cord when glial cells grow out of control.
* Pituitary tumors are abnormal growths that develop in the pituitary gland.
* A meningioma tumor arises from the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord.

## Glioblastoma
* Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive type of brain cancer, classified as Grade IV.
* It is associated with an improved response to chemotherapy with temozolomide and a patient's overall survival.

## MGMT
* MGMT promoter methylation status is a widely accepted biomarker in glioblastoma.
* Pituitary tumors are abnormal growths that develop in the pituitary gland.
* A meningioma tumor arises from the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord.

# Dataset

## UPENN GBM
* UPenn-GBM is a publicly available dataset of 630 patients diagnosed with de novo GBM.
* It is the largest comprehensive GBM dataset currently available.
* The dataset includes multi-parametric MRI scans, gene expression profiles, DNA methylation profiles, and clinical data.
* Clinical data includes patient demographics, treatment history, and survival outcomes.

## Patient Data
* Each patient has 4 brain MRI scans: T1-weighted, T2-weighted, T1 post-contrast, and T2-FLAIR MRI.
* Each patient has 155 slices of brain images.
* Clinical features include GLCM, Morphologic, Survival days, Age, Gender, and MGMT status.

# Implementation

# Future Scope
* Prediction of Overall Survival of patients.
* Calculation of MGMT Index.
* Using MGMT Index as a new feature for further prediction of Overall Survival.
* Inclusion of other types of data (clinical or gene expression) for further experimentation.
